Required configuration for peoper functioning of the application:

Database:
	Root / SELECT, INSERT, DELETE etc... permission user name & password
	A database name
	
	One part of app configuration is in ./files/p/dbconnect.php
	This database config file is used to perform serial data managment and custom
	user queries.
	
	Second part of app database configuration is in ./files/p/ulogin/config/pdo.inc.php.
	This file was slightly modified although you can replace the whole ulogin folder in either
	a newer version or the original file, it just requires more configuration to do.
	Also take a look at ./files/p/ulogin/config/main.inc.php.
	
	You can custom ./index.php to your needs. Reading of the ulogin documentation
	is highly recommended for proper set up of the system.
	
	The database snapshot is located in ./dbsnapshot.sql, and you can import it to your
	database via phpmyadmin or just execute the file. It comes with a built in user:
		username:	itay
		password:	1234
